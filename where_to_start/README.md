# ODS #wheretostart recommendations


It is impossible to be taught to be data scientist, but nowadays it is easy to become one yourself. As the amount of resources available online can be overwhelming, we'd like to suggest you the online courses (MOOCs), lectures and materials  that helped us become data scientists. Following suggested order is not required, but might be helpful.
